By Lou Hamilton.

When seated, a person's slacks will generally pull down at the back of
the waistline and have extra folds in the front. People who are
wheelchair bound find pants more comfortable when additional material is
allowed in the seat and less material in the front. Regular slacks can
be altered for a comfortable fit.

Fig. 1. Detach the waistband from a regular pair of slacks. A pair of
knit slacks will provide added comfort.

Fig. 2. Attach the front of each side of the waistband, lowering it to
the distance determined by measuring from the crotch seam to the
waistline plus 1" of ease. Stitch carefully over the zipper.

Fig. 3. Extend the back waistband at as much of an angle as possible,
with ends meeting in a vertical seam. Measure the back waist and the
depth of the angle at the center back.

Fig. 4. Using these two measurements, cut the insert piece from a
stretchy knit fabric allowing for seam allowances. Sew insert piece into
pants.

Fig. 5. The finished slacks are shaped especially to fit the seated
figure.
